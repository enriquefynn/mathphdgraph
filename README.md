#Math PhD Graph

With this you can get the full ancestry of the Mathematics academia in a visually appealing graph

You can also just use its methods like a library.

To re-download all graph do `npm install` and run the download_all.js script, it outputs a csv with all the database from the Mathematics Genealogy Project.

This is built using [Cytoscape](http://js.cytoscape.org/) and with the database gathered from the [Mathematics Genealogy Project](https://www.genealogy.math.ndsu.nodak.edu/index.php)

## Disclosure
I sent an email to the prof. owner of the Mathematics Genealogy Project which advised me to cease completely the usage of this program.
This database doesn't belong to a single so-called scientist.
